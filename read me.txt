To use this system:

1. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up your API keys in the `.env` file
3. Run `python main.py`

This will fetch the data, preprocess it, train the models, make predictions, and generate visualizations.

Remember to regularly update your training data and retrain your models to maintain their accuracy. Also, consider implementing a more sophisticated data updating mechanism for production use, as the current system fetches all data each time it runs.
